"""Simple program to find the length of a string using DSA logic.

This version is intentionally minimal and uses an explicit DSA-style
iteration to count characters (no use of Python's built-in len()).

Behaviour:
- Reads a line of input from the user
- Counts the characters by iterating and incrementing a counter
- Prints the length as an integer

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1) extra
