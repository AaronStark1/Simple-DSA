// 7. Program to Find the Size of int, float, double and char
// JavaScript doesn't have C-style types; we'll show typical sizes from C on common platforms.
// Usage: node size_of_types.js
console.log('Typical sizes on a common C implementation (bytes):');
console.log('int: 4');
console.log('float: 4');
console.log('double: 8');
console.log('char: 1');
console.log('\nNote: JavaScript only has Number (IEEE-754 double) and BigInt; sizes above are C conventions.');
