/*
Program to Check Whether a Number is a Power of 2.

Description:
Given an integer, determine whether it is a power of two.
A number is a power of two if it can be expressed as 2^n,
where n is a non-negative integer.

Example:
Input: 8
Output: 8 is a power of 2.

Explanation:
8 can be represented as 2^3, so it is a power of 2.

            Logic:
            - In binary, a power of two has exactly one bit set.
            - Example:
                1  -> 0001
                2  -> 0010
                4  -> 0100
                8  -> 1000
            - The expression (n & (n - 1)) clears the lowest set bit.
            - So, if (n & (n - 1)) == 0 and n > 0 â†’ it's a power of 2.
        */

            System.out.println(n + " is not a power of 2.");
