/**
 * Program to find the Maximum Profit from Stock Buy and Sell.
 *
 * Given an array where each element represents the price of a stock on that day,
 * the goal is to find the maximum profit by choosing a single day to buy
 * and a different day in the future to sell.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Buy at price 1 and sell at price 6 â†’ profit = 5
